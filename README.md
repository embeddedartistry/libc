# libc
Embedded Artistry's `libc` is a C standard library implementation targeted for embedded systems.

In order to conserve precious memory resources, this library does not supply the complete C standard library functionality. Instead, a subset of functions which are useful on bare-metal embedded systems has been selected. If you have a bare metal system and want to use the standard set of C functions, this library is for you!

Unlike many other C libraries that I've come across, this library implements unit tests and has addressed flaws in open-source implementations of the C standard library functions.

`malloc` and `free` are not included in this library. If you need dynamic memory allocation support, you can couple this library with the [Embedded Artistry `libmemory`][1], which contains implementations of `malloc` and `free`.

## About the Project

Embedded Artistry's `libc` is intended to provide a portable set of useful C standard library functions that allows quick bringup of new bare-metal embedded systems.

Additionally, we want to ensure a high-quality `libc` implementation by ensuring that each function has unit test coverage. Many C library function implementations are untested and contain errors. We are fighting poor implementations by adding test coverage.

In order to conserve precious memory resources, this library does not supply the complete C standard library functionality. Instead, a subset of functions which are useful on bare-metal embedded systems has been selected. This selection has primarily been driven by my own experience in bare-metal development. If you need additional features, please open a feature request.

The functional implementations in this library have been selected for portability and quick bringup of new systems. There may be more efficient implementations for these functions, but often they are architecture specific.

`malloc` and `free` are not included in this library. Because memory allocation schemes vary greatly with embedded systems (some not even allowing dynamic memory), you will need to supply your own implementations based on your system's needs. You can also couple this library with the [Embedded Artistry `libmemory`][1], which contains implementations of `malloc` and `free`.

## Project Status

This library does not supply `errno` support at this time.

The following portions of the C library have been implemented:

* ctype
* string
* stdlib
	* atoX
	* abs, labs, llabs
	* bsearch
	* calloc
	* div, ldiv, lldiv
	* heapsort, heapsort_r
	* imaxabs, imaxdiv
	* qsort, qsort_r
	* rand family
	* realloc
	* strtoX functions (many via `gdtoa`)

The following architectures are currently supported:

* x86
* x86_64

Up next:

* `assert` (`assert.h`)
* Hooks for `exit` and `abort` (`stdlib`)
* ARM architecture support
* Cross-compilation for ARM
* math.h and some definitions (INFINITY, NaN)
* `stdio`

The following unit tests need to be added:

* `bsearch`
* `imaxdiv`
* `div`, `ldiv`
* `realloc`
* `rand` family
* `strnstr`
* `memmove`

Maybe in the future:

* `wchar` support
* `errno` support (enabled as a compile-time switch)
* `getopt` support

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [CMocka][3] must be installed on your system to compile the unit tests
* [Doxygen][0] must be installed to generate documentation
* [Meson](#meson-build-system) is used as the buildsystem
* [`git-lfs`][7] is used to store binary files
* `make` and `gcc` should be installed in order to compile the files

#### Meson Build System

The [Meson][meson] build system depends on `python3` and `ninja-build`.

To install on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip ninja-build
```

To install on OSX:

```
brew install python3 ninja
```

Meson can be installed through `pip3`:

```
pip3 install meson
```

If you want to install Meson globally on Linux, use:

```
sudo -H pip3 install meson
```

#### `adr-tools`

This repository uses [Architecture Decision Records](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2018/4/5/documenting-architectural-decisions-within-our-repositories). Please install [`adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to contribute to architecture decisions.

If you are using OSX, you can install `adr-tools` through Homebrew:

```
brew install adr-tools
```

If you are using Windows or Linux, please install `adr-tools` via [GitHub](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

### Getting the Source

This project uses `git-lfs`, so please install it before cloning. If you cloned prior to installing `git-lfs`, simply run `git lfs pull` after installation.

This project is [hosted on GitHub][8]. You can clone the project directly using this command:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:embeddedartistry/libc.git
```

### Building

The library can be built by issuing the following command:

```
make
```

This will build all targets for your current architecture.

You can clean builds using:

```
make clean
```

You can eliminate the generated `Makefile`s and buildresults using:

```
make purify
```

#### Cross-compiling

Output is currently limited to `x86_64`, but cross-compiling for ARM will be implemented in the near future.

### Installation

Currently the best method to use this project is to build it separately and copy the contents into your tree. I will improve this method to allow easier usage as a submodule.

Copy the `include/` directory contents into your source tree.

Build artifacts are stored in the `buildresults` folder. You will find a `libc` folder which contains the compiled static library: `libc.a`

Copy the desired library to your project and add the library to your link step.

Example linker flags:

```
-lc -Lpath/to/libc.a
```

### Testing

The tests for this library are written with [CMocka][3]. You can run the tests by issuing the following command:

```
make test
```

By default, test results are generated for use by the CI server and are formatted in JUnit XML. The test results XML files can be found in `buildresults/testresults/`.

If you would prefer to see the test result summary printed to `stdout` instead, simply use the following command:

```
CMOCKA_MESSAGE_OUTPUT=stdout make test
```

## Formatting

This repository enforces formatting using [`clang-format`][2].

You can auto-format your code to match the style guidelines by issuing the following command:

```
make format
```

Formatting is enforced by the Jenkins build server which runs continuous integration for this project. Your pull request will not be accepted if the formatting check fails.

## Documentation

[Documentation for the latest release can always be found here][9].

Documentation can be built locally by running the following command:

```
make doc
```

Documentation can be found in `buildresults/doc`, and the root page is `index.html`.

Many of the open-source function implementations used in this library have been pulled from two primary sources:

* [Apple Open Source libc](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/)
	* abs, atof, bsearch, div family, heapsort/qsort family, abs family, imax family, strtol/ll/ull
	* fls, flsl, flsll
	* strstr, strtok. strnstr, strnlen, strndup, strncpy, strncat, strlen, strdup, strcpy, strcat
	* memmem, memcpy
* [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org)
	* All ctype member functions (locale support removed)
	* strrchr, strchrnul, strchr
	* memset, memrchr

I have also used and improved the open-source `gdtoa` library.

The initial groundwork of testing was implemented by referencing the [libc-test](http://nsz.repo.hu/git/?p=libc-test) project.
