### Continual Need: Documentation

Should you have a suggestion for the documentation, you can open an issue and outline the problem or improvement you have - however, creating the doc fix yourself is much better! By creating a new issue (or commenting on a related existing one), you let others know what you're working on. If you're making a small change (typo, phrasing) don't worry about filing an issue first - just open a Pull Request.

I currently need the most help with improving the libc in-source Doxygen documentation and commenting. If you would like to help, please select a header in the `include/` folder and add Doxygen style comments to functions with no documentation.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the PR to be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues. To generate the Doxygen documentation, run:

```
make docs
```

You can find the resulting output in `buildresults/docs` folder.

### Dependencies

The dependencies for [Embedded Artistry's standardized Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/) are described [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).

In addition to those dependencies, you will need the following for this repository:

* [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com) is used to store binary files

### Development Process

`master` contains the latest code for this project, and new versions are tagged nightly.

Please branch from `master` for any new changes. Once you are ready to merge changes, open a pull request. The build server will test and analyze the branch to ensure it can be safely merged.

### Building the Project

This project uses [Embedded Artistry's standardized Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/). Complete instructions can be found [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).
You can also build using CMake, eg `cd build && cmake -GNinja .. && ninja`.

### Adding New Tests

If you add code you need to add tests! Weâ€™ve learned the hard way that code without tests is undependable. If your pull request reduces our test coverage because it lacks tests then it will be rejected.

This project uses CMocka as the testing framework.

Please follow these guidelines:

* New tests should be added to the [`test/`](../test/) directory tree
	* If you are adding a new function to an existing module, please add it in that module's tree
		* e.g. `string/`, `stdlib/`, `ctype/`
	* If you are adding a new module or a function in a new module, please create that directory and add the file there.
* Each function should have its own tests in its own C file.
* Each module should have a C file which coordinates the tests.
	* e.g. [`string/string_tests.c`](../test/string/string_tests.c)
* When adding a new test, add the following to the relevant test coordination file:
	* An `extern` function declaration: `extern int memcpy_tests(void);`
	* A call to this test function: `overall_result |= memcpy_tests();`
* When adding a new module:
	* Please copy the test coordinator style from an existing module
	* Add an `extern` function declaration in [main.c](../test/main.c): `extern int ctype_tests(void);`
	* Add a call to the test coordinator in [main.c](../test/main.c): `overall_result |= ctype_tests();`
